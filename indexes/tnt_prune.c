/*
 * Pruning: candidate selection.
 *
 * A prune replaces three nodes -- an internal node, a leaf and an internal
 * node that are consecutive in the in-order sequence *and* adjacent in the
 * history chain -- with one new node holding only their valid entries. This
 * file picks those triples; nothing here mutates anything.
 *
 * The picking rule, in the names AGENTS.md and the plan use:
 *
 *   leaf  (L)     the leaf of the triple, a live appendable slab
 *   inner         L->lu_parent, the younger internal node
 *   outer         inner->lu_parent, the older internal node
 *   up    (D)     outer->lu_parent, NULL when outer is the history root
 *   sib   (A)     inner's other history child
 *   star  (*)     outer's other history child
 *   side  (s)     inner->lu_child[side] == L
 *
 * A triple is prunable iff it is consecutive in-order, historically local
 * (two of the three have their lu_parent inside the triple, i.e. the chain
 * segment L -> inner -> outer), and its valid entries fit in one slab.
 *
 * The test below is local to the history tree, and equivalent to scanning the
 * in-order sequence: with L on side `side` of inner and inner on the opposite
 * side of outer, history in-order reads "... sib-subtree, inner, L, outer,
 * star-subtree ...", i.e. the triple is consecutive. Same-side placement would
 * put sib's whole subtree between inner and L. History in-order equals routing
 * in-order, so consecutive there means consecutive here.
